# Pre-React
This repo created as a preparatory space for exploring and experimenting with foundational concepts before diving into React development. This project includes essential JavaScript practices, reusable components, and examples that build a strong base for React projects.

# Purpose
This repository serves as my learning and practice ground to strengthen my skills in:

1. JavaScript fundamentals.
2. Modular code organization.
3. Preparing for building robust React applications.
